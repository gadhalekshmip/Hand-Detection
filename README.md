# Hand Detection and Landmark Tracking
This project is a real-time hand detection program that uses OpenCV to access the webcam, MediaPipe to detect landmarks on the hand, and provides a black background to isolate the hand from the background noise. The program is capable of detecting and tracking landmarks for both hands simultaneously. Additionally, it allows capturing and saving frames when the 'S' key is pressed, and quitting the program when the 'Q' key is pressed. The captured frames are saved with a file path specified by the user.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you need to install the following packages:

Python 3.7 or higher
OpenCV
MediaPipe
You can install the required packages using the following command:

 *pip install opencv-python mediapipe*

## Usage
To use this hand detection program, follow these steps:

Ensure that your computer has a functional webcam..
Run the HandDet.py file using Python.
The program will open the webcam and start detecting and tracking the landmarks of your hands.
The output will display the black background with the detected hand landmarks highlighted.
Press the 'S' key to capture and save the current frame. Enter the desired file path when prompted.
Press the 'Q' key to quit the program.
Note: Ensure that your computer's webcam is properly connected and functional.
